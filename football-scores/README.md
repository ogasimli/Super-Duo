# Football Scores

Football Scores uses [football-data API](http://api.football-data.org/index) to retrieve match data.
In order to be able to launch the app you have to get a valid API key from football-data.org and add the following line to your gradle.properties file:

API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY

After that just replace YOUR_API_KEY with valid API key, obtained from football-data.org.
