# Super Duo
Third project within the Android Developer Nanodegree Program.

Super Duo was evaluated and graded as "Exceeds Specifications" by certified Udacity code reviewer.

## Project Overview

The main objective of the project was to productionize two apps, taking them from a functional state to a production-ready state.  This involved followings:
* Productionize two apps, taking them from a functional state to a production-ready state
* Find and handle error cases
* Add accessibility features
* Allow for localization
* Add a collection widget

## Why this Project?

Super Duo gave me an opportunity to diagnose problems in a pair of apps and also practice improving apps. These skills are vital to build apps users will love.

Diagnosing issues with existing apps is key to working on large apps or continuing projects in Android. Being aware of the common pitfalls in app design frees a developer to produce novel app experiences without making the same mistakes over and over.

## What I Have Learned?

During this project, I:
* Diagnosed existing issues with an app
* Made an app accessible to sight-impaired users
* Allowed app to be localized for distribution in other countries
* Handled error cases
* Added a collection widget to the app experience
* Leveraged the functionality of a library in the app
